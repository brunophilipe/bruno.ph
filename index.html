			<p>Graphical interfaces for package managers already existed for several (if not all) Linux distros, but there were none for Mac. I decided it would be a good opportunity to learn more about Cocoa development, and I had a lot of fun doing it.</p>
			<p>After a couple of bloggers mentioned Cakebrew in their work, it showed up on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7668383" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hacker News </a>, where it got 300+ points. That week the project popularity exploded: several GBs of traffic were observed in its homepage, and it was featured on GitHub trending repositories.</p>
			<p>After that, and over time, several people contributed to the project, and it evolved gracefully for a couple of years. Development stagnated after I started working full-time, and I never had the time to go over it again and do the improvements I want.</p>
			<p>Overall it makes available most of the basic features through the UI, and it still works well. Occasionally I still release updates to fix bugs when required.</p>

			<p>Many times while at work, or while managing one of my VPS machines, I felt like I wanted to play some specific song from my iTunes library. But because I had my screen covered with several terminal sessions, many times in full-screen, it felt like doing this  and then breaking my workflow was too much effort.</p>
			<p>So in a reversal of what I did with Cakebrew, I wrote a command-line tool to control a graphical application. Because ScriptingBridge, a fantastic feature from the heydays of Mac OS X, is still present in macOS, this was as easy as it can be. A simple programming interface is auto-generated, to which you can link and build code that sends and receives information from other applications.</p>
			<p>A first version was a simple command line input-output program, with at most a single prompt in case your query produced more than one relevant result. Later I rewrote almost the entire thing to have a prettier text interface, using <code>ncurses</code>.</p>

			<p>Widgets are meant to provide data that is brief and meaningful at a glance. When lock sreen widgets were announced, I quickly came up with the idea of this widget.</p>
			<p>It allows the user to pick which servers, and individual ports on each server, to test every time the widget becomes visible. Due to the limitations of the widget framework on iOS, it is not feasible to run the checks on the background and send notifications to the user, but it still works well enough.</p>
			<p>This is my most popular app in the App Store, and I believe it is because it has a simple premise, and delivers on it well. It was a simple App to develop, but I don't think this diminishes its relevance at all.</p>
