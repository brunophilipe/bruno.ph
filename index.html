<p>Here is where I put all of the projects I have created recently, or maybe not that recently, but that I still think are cool. Most of my projects involve the Swift programming language, and are Apps either for iOS or macOS.</p>

<p>Fell free to also visit my <a href="/blog">Blog</a>, where I occasionally write something about programming.</p>

			<p>A plain-text editor for macOS with a focus on a minimalistic user interface and powerful themes functionality.</p>

<p>Because some people prefer light text on dark background, others dark text on white backgrounds, some others enjoy sepia tones, and others something completely different, it seemed an important feature to allow the user to pick whichever colors they want for the entire document interface.</p>

<p>This project was inspired by a previous project of mine, <a href="/software/tiptyper">TipTyper</a>, which was also a plain-text editor, but written in Objective-C. That was a project that taught me Cocoa programming. Now that I feel I have a good knowledge of that library, it felt appropriate to re-do that project, but now using the fantastic Swift programming language.</p>

			<p>Graphical interfaces for package managers already existed for several (if not all) Linux distros, but there were none for Mac. I decided it would be a good opportunity to learn more about Cocoa development, and I had a lot of fun doing it.</p>

<p>After a couple of bloggers mentioned Cakebrew in their work, it showed up on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7668383">Hacker News</a>, where it aggregated over 300 points. That week the project popularity exploded: several GBs of traffic were observed in its homepage, and it was featured on GitHub trending repositories.</p>

<p>After that, and over time, several people contributed to the project, and it evolved gracefully for a couple of years. Development stagnated after I started working full-time, and I never had the time to go over it again and do the improvements I want.</p>

<p>Overall it makes available most of the basic features through the UI, and it still works well. Occasionally I still release updates to fix bugs when required.</p>

			<p>x2048 is a puzzle game for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch that I developed around 2012. It is a version of the (at the time) popular 2048 puzzle game, but on an hexagonal board instead of a 4x4 matrix.</p>

<p>It was my first proper game for iOS, and it presented several new challenges. It was made using Apple‚Äôs SpriteKit. One of the main challenges was creating the recursive algorithm that calculates the movement for each disc, detecting discs movements and merges. A bit later I also implemented in-app purchases using Apple‚Äôs iAP APIs, which was another fun challenge on itself.</p>

<p>At some point I ported the game for macOS, but the gameplay was less than optimal, so I never released it.</p>

			<p>Widgets in iOS are meant to provide data that is brief and meaningful at a glance. When lock screen widgets were announced, I quickly came up with the idea of this widget.</p>

<p>Simply put, it allows the user to pick which servers, and individual ports on each server, to test every time the widget becomes visible. Due to the limitations of the widget framework on iOS, it is not possible to run the checks on the background and send notifications to the user, but it still works well enough.</p>

<p>On top of that, there is a ‚ÄúTap to Update‚Äù button that allows the user to manually check for the status of all servers.</p>

<p>This is my most popular app in the App Store, and I believe it is because it has a simple premise, and delivers on it well. It was a simple App to develop, but I don‚Äôt think this diminishes its relevance at all.</p>

			<p>When I saw Woz demonstrating his ‚ÄúNixie-Tube wrist watch‚Äù, a behemoth that makes the Apple watch look like futuristic miniature tech, I decided it would be a good watch face to develop. However once it became clear Apple doesn‚Äôt want developers to create third party faces, I decided to simply make it anyway and put it on GitHub.</p>

<p>It was quite a challenge to build, in the end, since watchOS (especially watchOS 2, at the time) has very limited graphics capabilities. I had to render the watch face in memory using the CoreGraphics, output that to an image to later display in the screen.</p>

<p>It is a project I go over every once in a while and change some small things, and it certainly makes people curious when I show them my ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù watch face.</p>

			<p>This was an experiment to discover how complicated it would be to write an iPod simulator that actually plays music. Result: not too bad!</p>

<p>It uses the Audio library of the device it is running from (therefore won‚Äôt run properly in a simulator) and uses actual UIKit table views configured to emulate the iPod interface. Also, the click wheel accepts rotary inputs just like the real thing.</p>

<p>There are several unimplemented features, and many screens are blank when they are opened through navigation. But the basic music playback for artists, albums, and tracks is all there. It also includes an animated ‚ÄúNow Playing‚Äù screen that imitates the ‚Äúmarquee‚Äù txt labels used by the iPod UI.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Apps that emulate an iPod are vetoed by Apple (guess how many people must have tried that already), so this won‚Äôt be in the App Store any time soon‚Ä¶</p>

			<p>Many times while at work, or while managing one of my VPS machines, I felt like I wanted to play some specific song from my iTunes library. But because I had my screen covered with several terminal sessions, many times in full-screen, it felt like doing this and then breaking my workflow was too much effort.</p>

<p>So in a reversal of what I did with Cakebrew, I wrote a command-line tool to control a graphical application. Because ScriptingBridge, a fantastic feature from the heydays of Mac OS X, is still present in macOS, this was as easy as it can be. A simple programming interface is auto-generated, to which you can link and build code that sends and receives information from other applications.</p>

<p>A first version was a simple command line input-output program, with at most a single prompt in case your query produced more than one relevant result. Later I rewrote almost the entire thing to have a prettier text interface, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">ncurses</code>.</p>
